# UFOs

Purpose: 

  Utilizing Javascript and HTML to develop a website with a dynamic filtering table to review UFO sightings. The table can filter by mulitple criteria like date, city, state/province, country and shape. These filters can be used individually or in conjuction for a specific search. 
  
Results:

  This webpage can be used by allowing a user to search for a specfic type of sighting such as saucer shaped sightings, formation based light objects or by a particular location. The filters can be used together or just one filter, the search will run the specified criteria by hitting enter and then populate the results. 
  
Challenges: 

  The formating of the app file was difficult, the alignment of the code would not set correctly. The table also did not update to be able to run the ultiple filters. Quite a bit of formating a debugging was involved for this. 
  
Summary:

  A drawback to this design is the user must be familar with the UX and know the filters they want. The table of data must also be continually updated otherwise users will not get any results on some searches. Also the filters are limited to the enetered data for the table rather than an api to search for any loaction in the world. This leaves the page rather static and quite limited for its intended purposes of displaying UFO citings. Two recommendations for the imporvment of this page would be as follows:
  
  1. Tie the filtering to an api for geoloacting that matches the location to a given match value in the data table and displays a maps for it so a user can see where ina  given area sightings are more common.
  2. The data table should be continually updated with new citing or doen via crowd source enter data to make the data table dynamic.
